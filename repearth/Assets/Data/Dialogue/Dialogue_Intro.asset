  - The planet is fantastic from here!
  - But the situation down there is not the same...
  - Our Earth is angry...
  - We are like parasites to her, we are destroying the natural balance of the things...
  - Will the Earth forgive us? Will it restore the balance for us?
  - Or will it brings us to extinction?
